This is my final assignment of this course. 

This website introduces my hometown, Gunma, Japan. Each page consists of three sections such as a navigation, a main section, and a footer, using block and flex containers.

The index page shows an overview of the hometown. The character page uses a css box model to display a photo of Gunma's local character. The gallery page shows some pictures that simbolaize my hometown using flex container and flex items. The remaining two pages use floats to introduce famous hot springs and automobile manufacturers in Gunma.
