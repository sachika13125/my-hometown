                <h1>About My Hometown</h1>
                <p>My hometown is Gunma, Japan. Gunma is an inland prefecture 
                    with many mountains. It takes about one and a half hours 
                    from Tokyo by train. Actually, many  Japanese say Gunma has 
                    no attractive place and food, however it is confortable to 
                    live here.</p>
                <p>Gunma has such a cute local mascot which is called 
                    <a class="point" href="pages/character.html">Gunma-chan</a>. 
                    Gunma-chan is a local mascot character with a horse motif. 
                    The reason for the horse motif is that the letter 
                    for horse is used in the prefecture's name, "Gunma". 
                    Local character contests are held every year in Japan. 
                    This mascot has won the first prize several times.
                    It also works as a director of Gunma Publicity Deprtment, 
                    and it often shows up at local events.</p>
                <p>This prefecture is famous for the local mascot and hotsprings, 
                    but it has also several other attractions. You can see photos 
                    of them in <a class="point" href="pages/gallery.html">gallery page</a>.</p>
