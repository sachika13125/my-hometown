                <h1>Kusastu Onsen</h1>
                <p>Kusatsu Onsen is a famous hot spring that has been loved 
                    by people and has healed them since ancient times. 
                    In the Edo period (1603-1867), more than 10,000 people, 
                    including writers and poets, visited Kusatsu Onsen every 
                    year. It is said that even the 8th Tokugawa Shogun, 
                    Yoshimune, had Kusatsu's hot water carried to Edo Castle 
                    for bathing, and the town has flourished since ancient 
                    times.</p>
                <p>Yubatake, the symbol of Kusatsu Onsen, is located in the 
                    center of the Kusatsu Onsen district. Surrounded by 
                    restaurants, souvenir shops, and inns, the area is always 
                    crowded with people. The hot water that gushes out of the 
                    spring passes through a wooden gutter to the "Yudaki" (waterfall). 
                    The waterfall basin is attractive, with the pale emerald green 
                    water glistening in the water. The waterfall is illuminated 
                    at night to create a magical atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Gunma is not that far from Tokyo, so many people can easily 
                    come to Kusatsu Onsen. There are many inns, restaurants, 
                    and souvenir shops in the surrounding area, so you can spend 
                    all day here. For those who live in Gunma, this is one of the 
                    few places to go on a date.</p>
