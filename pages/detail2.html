                <h1>SUBARU</h1>
                <p>SUBARU is an automobile company founded in Ota, Gunma, Japan  
                    in 1953. Originally started in 1917 as an aircraft research 
                    institute, the production of SUBARU cars began in 1958 
                    with the light car "SUBARU 360". At that time, domestically 
                    produced cars were expensive and out of reach for the public. 
                    However, the "Subaru 360," a relatively inexpensive light car, 
                    played a major role in popularizing the use of private cars 
                    among Japanese.</p>
                <p>There is a SUBARU museum near my house, and elementary school students 
                    living in the area usually visit there as a social studies field trip. 
                    It gives them a good opportunity to learn about the history and industry 
                    of their town. It is also common to have friends and family members 
                    who work for SUBARU, as well as many workers from other Asian countries.</p>
